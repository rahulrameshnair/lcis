## What is it?
It is a Python based tool that aids in converting foreground life cycle inventories (LCI) in Brightway in compliance with the  life cycle inventory schema (LCIS). The detailed structure and background of LCIS is published elsewhere. (Link will be updated soon). SLIC is an anagram of LCIS. Please refer to this schema to understand the abbreviations and terms used below.
## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the git repo
2. Clone the ennvironment file environment.yml using conda

### Usage

The tool mainly consists of two modules - inventory and imports.

The main purpose of /Inventory deals with the export of brightway foreground datasets according to LCIS.
1. Open  and run the cells within the jupyter notebook /Inventory/export_lci.ipynb to generate the dataset files (csv, xlsx), dataset properties (csv) for your LCI. Follow the instructions within the notebook.
2. Open and run the /network/LCI_network.ipynb to generate the network file (graphml).
3. The metadata excel template is available at /export/templates.

*Note ^1^*: files generated by jupyternotebooks are stored within their root directory
*Note ^2^*: in all jupyternotebooks, there are some interactive elements such as selection windows (i.e, a window will pop to select a file). If you do not see them appear, usually they are present behind other open windows in your operating system. No idea, why this window does not immediately become active. This will be debugged later.


The main purpose of /Imports is to import excel datasets into Brightway and apply some linking strategies to link any missing exchanges and flows.

1. Open and run the cells in the jupyter notebook /Imports/import_excel_inventory.ipynb. Follow the instructions within the notebook.


## Compatibility

At present, the tool has been tested for compatibility with the following versions of Brightway and Python. Due to the rapidly evovling nature of Brightway, these versions have to be kept in mind prior to the utlization of SLIC.
- Brightway 2.4.2, 2.4.3
  - bw2calc 1.8.1, 1.8.2
  - bw2data 3.6.5, 3.6.6
  - bw2io 0.8.8
  - bw2analyzer 0.10
  - bw_migrations 0.1, 0.2
- Python: 3.9, 3.10

It has to be further noted that tool was mainly tested in VSCode, and Spyder using the environment cloned from environment.yml. There have been some unreproducible errors while using a conventional (browser based) jupyerserver. However, a future release of this tool will feature installation from package managers such as conda and/or pip. This, hopefully, circumvents such issues.
